This is not an absolute list, but just what first came to mind as I was thinking of what to add. It will serve as a reminder and a checklist.
* A basic dungeon
* Trap placement 
- Add a player character
- Movement and animation 
- Camera movement (follow)
- Placement collision for traps (no overlap)
- Health system
- Enemies with animations (walk/die)
- Simple enemy AI, go from A to B
- Trigger effect on traps (damage and animation)
- Simple point system (10 = 3 stars)
- Trigger effect on goal (points loss)
- Attack system for player
- Building phase and triggered level start
- Resource system (gold drops/requirements)
- UI
- Multiple levels
- Music
